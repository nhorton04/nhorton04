### Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I recently graduated from [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/), a data science bootcamp. You can view the projects I've completed [here](https://github.com/nhorton04?tab=projects) (click on `Linked Repositories`). I am working on getting a website up and running where you can look at my projects and use the apps I created in my final project.

### About Me
I'm a lifelong drummer and I love snowboarding. I also enjoy solving complex problems. I've worked as a technical writer at Qualcomm, Inc. and Target Solutions. I like debugging because I enjoy seeing how other people approached a problem, and pair programming for the ability to draw on another person's unique knowledge and skill set. My ideal first data science job is at a company where I can benefit from being around experienced professionals, learning as much as possible from them and constantly growing and cementing my skill set.
