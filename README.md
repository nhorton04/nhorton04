### Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I am currently studying data science at ![Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/). I will be looking to enter the workforce in less than 2 months! You can view the projects I've completed ![here](https://github.com/nhorton04?tab=projects).

### About Me
I'm a lifelong drummer and I love music. My band is currently on hold while I'm going through this boot camp, but I like to play rock, reggae, funk, and metal. I also enjoy snowboarding. Big jumps with kickers are my favorite, but I stay away from rails. 

I enjoy solving complex problems. I've worked as a technical writer at Qualcomm, Inc. and Target Solutions. It apparently isn't the most common opinion, but I like debugging because I enjoy seeing how other people approached a problem, and I truly enjoy pair programming for the ability to draw on another person's unique knowledge and skill set. My ideal first data science job is at a company where I can benefit from being around experienced professionals, learning as much as possible from them and constantly growing and cementing my skill set.
