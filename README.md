### Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm currently working as a Software Quality Operations Associate at Artech LLC supporting Google/Waymo.

I've created some cool web apps that leverage ML for image manipulation, but these are currently offline due to cost.

You can check out the online store for my brothers' embroidery business at https://serafinistitches.com ; I built it using the MERN stack - MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS.

Future projects to come!
